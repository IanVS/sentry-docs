## Overview

High-volume projects that generate many events can quickly consume a large portion of your billing quota, leaving less room for other projects and decreasing visibility across them.

With high-volume projects, you'll often see many similar events, which can be redundant and less helpful for debugging. But with Dynamic Sampling, you can maximize your quota by adjusting sample rates based on each project’s event volume. The sample rate is a percentage from 0% (no events passed) to 100% (all events passed), that can be tailored to each project’s needs.

When you use Dynamic Sampling, projects in your organization are sampled based on their recent event volumes. High-volume projects are sampled at lower rates while lower-volume projects are sampled at higher rates or not sampled at all, based on your recent event data. This makes it possible for each project to retain a meaningful set of key events, improving visibility into all projects regardless of their size.










## Modes

When you are using Dynamic Sampling for a specific organization, you can set the mode in which it operates. You can either choose the manual mode or the automatic mode:

    * **`automatic`**: This is the default setting and it means that the sample rate for each project in the organization determined automatically. When you chose this mode, the project sample rates are calculated according to the relative volumes of the projects so that the projected sampled events fill organization quota, boosting low volume projects. This recalibration happens in regular intervals.
    When you set the mode to `automatic`, any manually set project sample rates are overridden.

    * **`manual`**: In this mode, you can specifically set the sample rate for each project in the organization. This mode is useful when you want to have exact control over the sample rates of your projects. In this mode, no automatic recalibration happens.
