## Overview

When you are dealing with projects that generate high volumes of events, your quotas might be consumed quickly. Additionally, high volume projects will eat up a bigger portion of it, leaving less for other projects.

Many events may be redundant or not useful for debugging. Dynamic Sampling allows you to make the most of your quota by dynamically determining a target sample rate from the given volumes of the projects.

When you use Dynamic Sampling, your projects within an organization are sampled according to their event volumes of the past period. Higher volume projects are sampled at a lower rate, while lower volume projects are sampled at a higher rate or not sampled at all. This way, each project has a similar set of significant events to investigate, granting more visibility to the spans that actually matter.

A sample rate is a percentage from 0% (no events are passed on) to 100% (all events are passed on). 

## Modes

When you are using Dynamic Sampling for a specific organization, you can set the mode in which it operates. You can either choose the manual mode or the automatic mode:

    * **`automatic`**: This is the default setting and it means that the sample rate for each project in the organization determined automatically. When you chose this mode, the project sample rates are calculated according to the relative volumes of the projects so that the projected sampled events fill organization quota, boosting low volume projects. This recalibration happens in regular intervals.
    When you set the mode to `automatic`, any manually set project sample rates are overridden.

    * **`manual`**: In this mode, you can specifically set the sample rate for each project in the organization. This mode is useful when you want to have exact control over the sample rates of your projects. In this mode, no automatic recalibration happens.
