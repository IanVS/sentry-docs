## Overview

Dynamic Sampling provides a benefit to organizations with project of varying event volumes. It aims to provide a representative set of samples for events. High volume projects are sampled at a lower rate, while low volume projects are sampled at a higher rate, so that each has a similar set of significant events to investigate.

## Sampling mode

The sampling mode can be set at the organization level. This will apply to all projects within the organization. The available options are:

*   **`organization`**: This is the default setting. It means that the sample rate is determined automatically at the organization level. This mode is also called "automatic", as the individual project sample rates are calculated by the volume of events in the project.

    When set to this mode, the project specific sample rates are continuously recalibrated, depending on the relative volumes of the projects.

* **`project`**: This means that the sample rate is configured at the project level. This is useful if you want to have specific sample rates for different projects.
