## Installation Recommendations: GitHub Releases or Fab

<Note>
While Unreal Engine uses "plugins", we will refer to the Sentry support we offer within Unreal Engine as the Sentry Unreal Engine SDK.
</Note>

There are three common ways to install an SDK to use with Unreal Engine:
1. Install from the [Epic Games Fab](https://www.fab.com/) ([formerly known as the marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/fab-epics-new-unified-content-marketplace-launches-today))
2. Download a pre-built SDK that you install (e.g. from a GitHub Releases page)
3. Clone and build the SDK yourself and install

Being Fair Source, Sentry offers all three for you to be able to get the insights only Sentry can provide. However, each has it's own limitations.
