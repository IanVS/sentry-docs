<Alert level="info" title="Currently in Beta">

The support for **feature flag change tracking** and **feature flag evaluation tracking** is currently in beta.

</Alert>

The [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the OpenFeature SDK. These evaluations are held in memory and, in the event an error occurs, sent to Sentry for review and analysis.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk'
```

## Configure

Add `OpenFeatureIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.OpenFeature import OpenFeatureIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        OpenFeatureIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Verify

The integration is tested by evaluating a feature flag using your OpenFeature SDK before capturing an exception.

```python
from openfeature import api
import sentry_sdk

client = api.get_client()
client.get_boolean_value("hello", default_value=False)
    
sentry_sdk.capture_exception(Exception("Something went wrong!"))
```

Visit the Sentry website and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "hello" and its value "false".

Please read the note below to ensure that you also complete one additional step.

<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

In order to take full advantage of the feature flag capabilities Sentry offers, there is an additional setup step needed, which is setting up your integration-specific webhook. This is needed to enable **feature flag change tracking**, so that your integration may communicate feature flag changes to Sentry. Learn how to set this up by [reading the docs](/product/explore/feature-flags/#set-up-your-integration-specific-webhook).
