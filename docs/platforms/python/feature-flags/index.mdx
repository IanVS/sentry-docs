<Alert level="info" title="Currently in Beta">

**Feature flag change tracking** and **feature flag evaluation tracking** is currently in closed beta. If you'd like to be added to the beta, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/EeNwTepvVwt7poAJ8).

</Alert>

Link your external feature flag integrations with Sentry to provide feature flag insights right inside the Sentry UI. Linking one or more integrations will allow you to view recent flag evaluations in one place and identify potential suspect flags related to errors. In addition, Sentry will provide insights on feature flag updates relative to error event timelines.

## Enable Evaluation Tracking

Evaluation tracking requires enabling an SDK integration. Integrations are provider specific. Documentation for supported providers is listed below.

- [OpenFeature](/platforms/python/integrations/openfeature/)
- [LaunchDarkly](/platforms/python/integrations/launchdarkly/)

## Enable Change Tracking

Change tracking requires registering a Sentry webhook with your feature flag provider. Set up varies by provider and is documented in detail [here](/product/explore/feature-flags/#set-up-your-integration-specific-webhook).
