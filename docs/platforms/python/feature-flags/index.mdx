Link your external feature flag integrations with Sentry to provide feature flag insights right inside the Sentry UI. Linking one or more integrations will allow you to view recent flag evaluations in one place and identify potential suspect flags related to errors. In addition, Sentry will provide insights on feature flag updates relative to error event timelines.
