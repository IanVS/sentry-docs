Sentry's app start instrumentation provides insight into how long your application takes to launch.

<Note>

App start instrumentation is available on **iOS** and **Android**.

</Note>

## Instrumentation Behaviour

Before diving into the configuration, it's important to understand how app start instrumentation behaves:

- It tracks the length of time from the **earliest native process initialization** until the very first frame rendered that is reported by [addTimingsCallback](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/scheduler/SchedulerBinding/addTimingsCallback.html). Once the app start is processed, the SDK removes the callback in order to avoid additional overhead.
- After receiving information about the start and end times of the app launch, the SDK does the following:
  - creates a transaction with the name `ui.load`
  - in the transaction attaches a span with the operation `app.start.cold` or `app.start.warm`
  - attaches the app start metrics to the transaction

<Note>

The SDK differentiates between a cold and a warm start, but doesn't track hot starts/resumes.

</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

1. The Sentry Flutter SDK is initialized. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/#configure)
2. Tracing is set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/tracing/).

## Configure

This instrumentation is automatically enabled. There is no need for further configuration.

## Verify

### 1. Launch your app:

Launch your Sentry configured app.

### 2. Locate Your Transaction:

Open the [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) performance dashboard, find, and select the 'root /' transaction.

### 3. View App Start Metrics:

Select the event within your transaction. Sentry.io displays the app start metrics on the right side of the screen in the **Mobile Vitals** section.
