<Alert level="info">

This integration only works inside a browser environment.

</Alert>

_Import name: `Sentry.browserSessionIntegration`_

Sentry's [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) feature allows you to track user adoption and your application's crash-free rate.

The BrowserSession integration will create a Session that is used to track the health of your release when the user loads your page or application.
Sessions will be marked as faulty when an error is captured while a Session is active.
Read more about <PlatformLink to="/configuration/releases/#sessions">Sessions</PlatformLink>.

```JavaScript
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [Sentry.browserSessionIntegration()],
});
```
